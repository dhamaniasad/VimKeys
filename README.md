A HTML guide to Vim keyboard commands

Intent
---
As I started to learn Vim with MacVim I could only find relatively dated cheat
sheets for Vim. This being the web I decided to create an HTML-based cheat
sheet that will emulate the look and feel of the keyboard, be printable but
most importantly interactive to help users understand what each command does
and how to use it best.
